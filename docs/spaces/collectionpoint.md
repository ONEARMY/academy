# How to setup a Collection Point

###  Great for transforming plastic waste into batches of objects using moulds.

So you want to set up an injection workspace. Awesome! Setting up a workspace can be broken down into three main steps:

- <b>Search:</b> what to think about when choosing your space
- <b>Plan:</b> how to plan your space effectively
- <b>Build:</b> transforming an empty room into a injection workspace

Each of these steps is explained in more detail below.

### Ready?

Let’s dive in. Before you start, there are a few things to consider.

1. People: assemble your team (it’s more fun with friends!)
2. Space: do you have enough? We’re working with a 4x6 metre space.
3. Location: is it easy to find?

### 🛠 Let’s build!

The goal of setting up and operating this workspace is to collect and sort plastic, so you’ll need to be pretty organised. We recommend using large bags or containers to store everything, and it’s important to separate your plastic based on type - so be sure to mark the bags to make sure everything goes in the right place.

And if you’re lucky enough to be able to get a consistent source of recycling, say the plastic spoons from your local ice cream store, then you can store these separately as you collect them so you can maintain consistency.

An important part of being the collection point for your local community is how you engage both online and offline, so in your workspace it’s great to have a workstation where you can organise online with campaigns, social media, partnerships and collaborations.

> Tip: teach your local community to clean their plastic before they bring it into you. It will help them understand the different types of plastic, as well as save you scrubbing off old yoghurt! If you set up a washing station at the collection point, they can also wash it there if they forget.

Have a whole bag ready to go? Be sure to label it properly with a label that won’t fall off, so that the workspace you pass it on to know what type of plastic they’re receiving. Before you pass it on to them make sure to weigh the plastic and keep a record of it so you know how much plastic you’re collecting (it would be cool to let your community know as well!) and since you’re there, upload the weight to upload.preciousplastic.com so we can see how much our entire global community is collecting 💪

### What else can you do?

Seeing plastic as beautiful, valuable objects is a huge motivator for people bringing in their plastic, it’s nice to have a display to show off the Precious Plastic products being made from the plastic you’re collecting.

There are many different ways you can collect plastic - people can bring it to you, or you can go and get it from them, but will depend on what’s possible in your area. Check out our series of <a href="url">Collection How-To's</a> to get inspired! But whatever approach you take, make sure that everyone that comes to your workspace has a nice, friendly experience. And of course in true Precious Plastic style, we’ve made some posters that you can hang up :)

So that’s it! Your needs will change depending on your own situation so make sure you adapt to what’s relevant for you and your community - make sure to share your experiences so we can all grow together. What’s next?
