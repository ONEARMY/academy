# Frequently asked questions

## üí¨ General

<details><summary><b>How do I get started?</b></summary>
<p>

Our [main website](https://preciousplastic.com/) explains the overall picture of Precious Plastic. The [Academy](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/intro.html) has video tutorials and information for you to learn how to start recycling plastic. The [Map](https://community.preciousplastic.com/map) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/gwkbpsWbAB) can connect you with recyclers in your local area. Be sure to add a pin to the map when you are up and running!
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>How can I share back to Precious Plastic?</b></summary>
<p>

Precious Plastic is an open-source project. This means that you can share back your knowledge with the rest of the community to help grow the recycling base. There are two main ways to do so: 
- How-Tos, these are step by step instructions that show tips and tricks you have discovered during your recycling journey. Whether these are a machine hack, new product, mould, event hosting or anything in between, we want to hear about them!
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/gwkbpsWbAB), share your know-how helping people who come with questions on our Discord. The best thing is to help new recyclers avoid mistakes you may have made so that more quality recycling can happen more often. We are very happy for people to share their knowledge and are grateful.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>How do I collaborate with Precious Plastic?</b></summary>
<p>

Precious Plastic has a page for [Collabs](https://preciousplastic.com/collabs.html). This is where we work with forward-thinking partners to create recycling projects around the world. You can learn more about it on the Collabs page. If you wish to start up a workspace check out our [Starterkits](https://preciousplastic.com/archived/starterkits/overview.html). 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>I have an idea for Precious Plastic, where can I share it?</b></summary>
<p>

All ideas are welcome and much appreciated. Use Discord to gauge your initial ideas with the community, we have channels for machines, products, collections and more.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>I want to work for Precious Plastic, how can I apply?</b></summary>
<p>

We are a small remote team currently based in Portugal. When we have openings and opportunities we post them on Discord or social media. If you would like to work or do an internship learning recycling, check out the Map and ask  local workspaces for job opportunities in your area.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>What is open source?</b></summary>
<p>

"Open source" refers to something that people can modify and share - its contents are "open". The term comes from the software industry where open source referred to the source code being open, nowadays the term has expanded to include hardware, products, research, design, just about anything that can be collaborative and non-proprietary!
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>What is the aim of Precious Plastic?</b></summary>
<p>

The aim of Precious Plastic is to provide a global solution to the plastic waste problem. We provide machine plans, product designs, knowledge on plastic and the industry, business models and a full ecosystem that can be adopted by anyone that wants to take the problem into their own hands. Everything we learn and publish online is free and open for anyone to use and modify.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>How can I contribute?</b></summary>

We'd love you to join our community and become part of the Precious Plastic Universe. We‚Äôre working towards more decentralised and collaborative processes to develop Precious Plastic further, check out our Discord to learn how you can contribute. If you'd like to contribute to us financially, you can become a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/one_army) or visit our [support](https://preciousplastic.com/support.html) page to find another way to help.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Machines
<details><summary><b>Where is the Download Kit?</b></summary>
<p>

The [Download Kit](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/download) is in the Academy. It has the main kit with everything needed to start plastic recycling, plus each [Starterkit](https://preciousplastic.com/archived/starterkits/overview.html) has its own download kit.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>Do you sell the machines?</b></summary>
<p>

No. We do not sell machines. We prefer that people build them locally or hire a machine shop. Just to make it clear, WE DO NOT SELL MACHINES :)
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>Where can I buy the machines?</b></summary>
<p>

You can buy machines or parts on the [Precious Plastic Bazar](https://bazar.preciousplastic.com/). Make sure to buy from someone around you to reduce delivery carbon emissions. Check out the Map on our Community Platform, or the Bazar to see what's available locally.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>Can I build the machines and sell them?</b></summary>
<p>

Yes, we would love that. The more people recycle, the better. The profit is all yours my friend! You can sell the machines via the [Precious Plastic Bazar](https://bazar.preciousplastic.com/).
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>Are the machines safe to work with?</b></summary>
<p>

If you build them according to our drawings, it should be ok. Overall they are safe to work with. However, a machine like a shredder can do quite some damage. But you can always customise the machines and make them safer. For more safety tips, check out the [How-tos](https://community.preciousplastic.com/how-to). Either way, please always watch out!
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>What are the requirements? (Space, tools/equipment, money, time, people)</b></summary>
<p>

It's different for every machine, the best place to find this information is in the [Build](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/build) section of the Academy. If you have any further questions, ask the community on [Questions](https://community.preciousplastic.com/questions) if it's a technical question or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/gwkbpsWbAB) if it's about other topics..

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>How much energy do the machines consume?</b></summary>
<p>

You can find all the output technical details on the [starterkit](https://preciousplastic.com/starterkits/showcase/shredder) pages of our website.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>I have a technical question, where can I get help?</b></summary>
<p>

You can use [Questions](https://community.preciousplastic.com/questions). Many talented and informed community members and engineers are there and might be able to help you!
</p>
</details>

## ü•§ Plastics

<details><summary><b>What is plastic?</b></summary>
<p>

See the [Plastic](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/plastic/basics) section in the Academy.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>Can I use all plastic types in Precious Plastic machines?</b></summary>
<p>

Nope. We usually recommend HDPE (#2), PP (#5), and PS (#6) as the plastic types that work best in the Precious Plastic machines. Ask around the community about other types.  
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>Is it dangerous to work with plastic?</b></summary>
<p>

It's not overly dangerous to work with plastic as long as you follow the proper precautions. However, different plastic types have different requirements. Refer to the [Safety and Fumes](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/plastic/safety) section of the Academy.PVC is toxic, so don‚Äôt work with it.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>How do I know what type of plastic something is?</b></summary>
<p>

Hopefully, the piece of plastic you're referring to is marked with a number from 1 to 7. If it is, hooray! You can easily search online or check out our [Basics of Plastic](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/plastic/basics) section which goes into more detail. If it's not marked, it's a little more difficult. There are techniques such as density testing, infrared testing and burn to test. You can also get to know more about what kinds of plastic are used for common products (for example, chemicals are often stored in HDPE bottles). You can learn about all these topics in the [Nerdy on Plastic](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/plastic/nerdy) in the Academy.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>How many times can you reuse plastic?</b></summary>
<p>

Plastic is a pretty strong material and as long as it's sorted and cleaned properly, in theory, it could be recycled many times. Depends on the plastic type, but the industry says it's usually around 10 times. But the point is to make long-lasting items to keep them out of our earth/ocean/atmosphere as long as possible.
</p>
</details>


<details><summary><b>Can Precious Plastic recycle PET?</b></summary>
<p>

We don‚Äôt have solutions for PET yet, head over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/gwkbpsWbAB) and help us develop novel solutions to deal with PET.
</p>
</details>

<p>

You can purchase products from the Precious Plastic community on the [Bazar](https://bazar.preciousplastic.com/).
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>Do you sell products?</b></summary>
<p>

Nop, we don't sell products.</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>I have an idea for a product, can you make it for me?</b></summary>
<p>

Nop, currently we cannot help you with product design. You can use the [Map](https://community.preciousplastic.com/map) to find a workspace to help you or chat with people on [Discord](https://discord.gg/gwkbpsWbAB).</p>

Translation has been requested since day one and has been difficult to figure out. We have content in many different formats and platforms.
