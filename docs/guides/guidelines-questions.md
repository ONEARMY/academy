In a nutshell, this module is here to help you find answers to your technical questions about plastic recycling, machine operation, material properties and more.

⚠️ Before posting your question, check it hasn’t already been asked to ensure that your question hasn't already been answered.


# How to ask a question

Technical questions can be complex, and it's easy to get lost in the details as there are many variables involved. However, even a simple question with a clear explanation and a few relevant images or diagrams can be incredibly helpful to others. 
Here are some guidelines to keep in mind when asking a technical question:


## The Question (title)

Select a title that accurately reflects the content of your question, making it easier for others to find and answer. Try to keep it short.

Examples:
- ✅”How to clean PP to get better recycled material after shredding?”
- ✅”How to work with labels?”
- ❌”I would like to know how to improve my way of working”


## Description

- Ask a specific question related to your problem or goal, rather than a general or open-ended question.
- If your question is about a problem you’re having, explain what you are experiencing in detail, including any unusual behaviour you have observed.
- Clearly state what you are trying to achieve, and what’s the expected behaviour.
- Include relevant details such as the specific machine you are using, the materials and tools involved, the type of plastic you are using, steps you have taken to troubleshoot or resolve the issue, anything that helps the community understand your situation.
- If possible, attach photos to better illustrate your question.
- If someone provides an answer to your question, let them know if it has worked or not. People are offering their time and expertise to help you :)

Examples:
- ✅ ”The motor is not running, and I've checked the power supply and fuses, but everything seems fine. I've also checked the motor connections and they seem secure. Can anyone provide some guidance on how to troubleshoot this issue? I've attached some photos of the machine and the motor for reference. Thanks in advance for your help!”

- ❌ "I don't understand why my injection machine won't work. I've tried everything and nothing is working. Can someone please tell me why it's not working and how to fix it?”

That's how we stay organised: this will be how people find your question, so make sure they’re accurate.


# Some tips & tricks

- Titles are powerful. Choose wisely, keep it short.
- Try to keep it short but informative: trust us, we all have short attention spans.


# How to answer a question

- Provide detailed and specific answers that address the questioner's needs and concerns. Avoid providing vague or general answers that don't provide enough context or detail.
- Provide accurate and reliable information that is based on your knowledge and experience. 
- Avoid speculation or guesswork, and provide references or sources when possible.
- Be cautious when providing advice or instructions related to safety or hazardous materials.
- Encourage the questioner to continue learning and exploring the topic, and provide resources or references for further study.
- Follow up on your answers and provide feedback or additional information if necessary. Encourage the questioner to provide feedback or ask follow-up questions if they have any.
