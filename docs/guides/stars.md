# Welcome to the Precious Plastic Community Program

The plastic problem is big. At Precious Plastic we believe that it can only be tackled by a strong, united movement of people and projects collaborating together.

Precious Plastic can do a lot to help Precious Plastic Spaces around the world. Likewise, Precious Plastic Spaces around the world can do a lot to help grow the Precious Plastic movement. The stronger Precious Plastic (the movement), the stronger Precious Plastic Spaces, the greater the impact on plastic pollution.

We look at several different objective factors when evaluating projects to become a Verified workspace. In addition to being an Ally, we require having 8+ stars on the Ally Checklist, a legal entity for over a year, at least 1500 followers on your most active social media account, 2 full-time paid employees and professional references. Each of these requirements needs to be fulfilled to become a Verified Workspace. These objective categories allow us to determine the quality (machines, products, moulds, workshops etc..), trustworthiness, track record, open-source mentality and more.
