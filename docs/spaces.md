# Precious Plastic Spaces

Precious Plastic Spaces are the building blocks of the Precious Plastic Universe. Each space takes care of one element of the recycling process. Focusing and mastering one aspect at the time. Different spaces are interconnected and dependent on each other, collaborating and sharing knowledge, plastic and expertise to tackle the plastic waste problem locally.  

To help you get started on the right foot we’ve designed, built and tested each Precious Plastic Space with simplicity, productivity, and quality of life in mind. In the following sections you’ll find a step-by-step guide with floor plans, CAD models, and tool recommendations to help you plan the various elements of your plastic recycling space.


### As you work, there are a few general things to keep in mind:

<b>1. Work together.</b> Find a teammate. Or two. Having someone to share tasks with makes the work more fun and easier to handle. It’s best if you and your teammates have complementary skillsets – engineer + businesswoman, for example.

<b>2. Customize.</b> Your context (space, location, products) will affect the way you set up your Precious Plastic Space. Use the plans here as a starting point, and always be on the lookout for ways to adapt them to better suit your needs.


<b>3. Keep it simple.</b> We recommend starting with the most basic elements of your space (machine, workbench, basic tools) and building out from there as you start to work with your machines or techniques. This way, you’ll build and buy only what suits your needs.

<b>4. Welcoming.</b> Your workspace is more than a recycling center - it’s a tool for cultural change. Take care of the little details to make it a nice and enjoyable place to be for you, your team, and visitors.
