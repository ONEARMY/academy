# Welcome

The goal of Food Better is to offer people a systematic way to improve their eating.

People share the adjustments (small and large) they make to their eating habits, which all together, have an impact on the world.

Food can be a senstive topic. One day at work, I was speaking with a colleague during lunch, a good, funny guy. The fact he is vegan was mentioned casually. I immediately felt a pang of defensiveness. After a moment, I could explain my feelings: it was as if his decision to not eat animal products reflected badly on me. His basic existance was now a judgement against me. This internal defensiveness shutsdown logic and openess. He did nothing wrong.

The Food Better community is a safespace, you are free to eat meat or not, harassment will not be tolerated.

Factual discussions about any foods and their impact on the world is allowed though. Meat eaters are encouraged to not shy away from learning more. Plant eaters should also be aware that their food may come still at the cost of exploitation, in the form of [poorly paid workers](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/howb32/reminder_that_our_plantbased_diet_is_not_cruelty/) or [unsttainable farming practices](https://youtu.be/bLH-Xh_y4uU?t=294), but maybe not.

But as always: the first time is the hardest and don't let good be the enemy of perfect.

## What does the *better* in Food Better mean?

Currently, we focus on:
* Non-recyclable packaging 
* Ethical production
* Health
* Price
* Convenience/effort
* Emotional aspects
* Taste

Why do some of these things matter? Well, if something is a pain for me (and I find having a large grocery bill to be painful), then it is tougher for me to stick with long-term.

Factors that probably won't be considered:
* the company's supply chain impact on the environment. Why?
-- 1) I don't know how to do that analysis.
-- 2) Let's keep it simple for now.

The goal is to find a perspectives where our self-interest aligns with The Greater Good, because then we are more likely to take action and continue.
