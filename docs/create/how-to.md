# Learn more in our how-tos!

This is a powerful place on the web. Here people from around the world (like you) can share the things they've learned with others in a structured way. This tool is the heart of our open-source, collaborative community. We rely on all of you to gain knowledge from us and then share your learnings back, that way we are all solving the problem of plastic waste together! [Read more here on why sharing back is crucial](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/universe/contribute)  

> Pro-tip: have a look at our [how-tos](https://community.preciousplastic.com/how-to) its fun to browse around :)

# How to make... a How-to
Ok, you‚Äôve had a look around the how-tos, perhaps used some of them, and now you‚Äôre ready to post your own. We and everyone in the Precious Plastic community really REALLY appreciates you taking the time to document your valuable information. Processes and development can be complex. It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the perfection of creating the perfect how-to with 45 steps. Aim for that. We love those. But realistically most other makers can get a lot of information from a good 3D model or a few pictures. If you upload that with a few steps thats explain roughly whats going on and why you are doing already helps a lot. Here a few guidelines to take in account



## Intro
<b>Title of your How-to:</b> is it indicative of the goal? Is it easy to understand? Remember, keep it short.

<b>Select tags for your How-to (max 4)</b> Select accurate tags, then your How-To will be found.

<b>How long does it take?</b> Helps users plan their time.

<b>Difficulty level?</b> Objective, we know! Try to select from the type of user that will be completing a How-To. Creating a basic mould from someone that has no experience will probably find it quite hard. But for a mould maker, easy.

<b>Short description of your How-to:</b> keep it to 300 characters please!
Upload files: do you have CAD drawings, testing sheets, or resources that will help? Zip them in a folder and upload them here. Aim to keep it under mb.

<b>Cover photo:</b> upload a landscape photo that shows your product or process clearly. We are visual creatures, good imagery will communicate quicker than text will. Keep it to 1280x960px.

## Steps

Ok now for the good stuff. Each step needs an intro, a description and photos. You‚Äôll need to have three steps minimum, and if you want to add more, you‚Äôll need to click ‚ÄúAdd Step‚Äù at the bottom.

<b>Intro:</b> again, keep it short

<b>Description:</b> edit it down to the essentials, and don‚Äôt make it a stream of text. If you have to much text for one step, it probably means your step is two big and it's better to split it up in 2 steps. This makes it easier to digest for others.
<b>Photos:</b> make sure they‚Äôre clear and useful to the step.

> __Pro tip 1 :__ Best is to always document (with lots of notes & photos) during the entire process of whatever you‚Äôre doing, so you have content ready for documenting.

## Categories

Each How-to can be part of one of 4 categories: Machines, Moulds, Products or Guides. Each category has some slightly different requirements (‚úÖ) and guidelines (üëç). Learn below how to optimise your How-to to fit its category.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Machines
> See specific guidelines [here](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/guides/guidelines-machines)
‚úÖ Cover image should show the fully built machine<br>
‚úÖ Include files to replicate the machine (drawings, cad, 3d files etc..)<br>
üëç Few steps we advise having:
- Step 1 > Explain the machine<br>
- Step 2 > Mention tools required<br>
- Step 3 > Challenges building the machine <br>
- Step 4 > Explain how to run it<br>
- Step 5 > Tips & tricks<br>
- Step 6 > Link to the Bazar if you sell it there<br>

### üíÖ Moulds
> See specific guidelines [here](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/guides/guidelines-moulds)
‚úÖ Cover image should show the fully built mould<br>
‚úÖ Include files to replicate the mould (cad, 3d files etc..)<br>
üëç Few steps we advise having:
- Step 1 > Explain the mould<br>
- Step 2 > Mention tools required<br>
- Step 3 > Challenges producing the mould <br>
- Step 4 > Explain how to use the mould<br>
- Step 5 > Tips & tricks<br>
- Step 6 > Show the final product<br>
- Step 7 > Link to the Bazar if you sell it there<br>

### üî´ Products
‚úÖ Cover image should show the final product<br>
üëç Include files to replicate the product if needed<br>
üëç Few steps we advise having:
- Step 1 > Explain the product<br>
- Step 2 (as many steps as needed) > Talk about the process<br>
- Step 3 (as many steps as needed) > Challenges making the product<br>
- Step 5 > Tips & tricks<br>
- Step 6 > Show the final product<br>
- Step 7 > Link to the Bazar if you sell it there<br>

### üìñ Guides
‚úÖ Cover image should show the topic of the guide<br>
üëç Include files to replicate if needed<br>
üëç Few steps we advise having:

## Guidelines

### ‚úèÔ∏è Text
- max. 700 characters per step
- Upload Minimum 3 steps
- Keep it simple! Think of your documentation as a beginners guide.
- We recommend simple language and a conversational tone.
- It‚Äôs better to have more easy steps than a few very complex ones.
- If you have too much information to put into one step then try to split it up into more steps.

### üì∏ Images
- Every step must include 1-3 images.
- All images should be landscape (4:3) best at (1920x1440)
- Nice & clean cover image showing what to learn in the How-to
- It can be useful to include technical drawings or templates, if it doesn't fit add them as download file.
- Try to make clear and clean photos showing what needs to be seen (cleaning your space could help ;)).
- If possible, every step should include a photo showing the result of that step.
- A good picture of the end result is pure gold.


### üì¶ Download files

- Add downloadable files to support your documentation: detailed drawings, CAD-files, a material list etc.
- Bundle all your files into 1 .zip file. Easier to share around. :)


## Some tips & tricks:

1. <b>Titles are powerful.</b> Choose wisely, keep it short.
2. <b>Use tags,</b> that's how we stay organised: this will be how people find your How-To, so make sure they‚Äôre accurate.
3. <b>Try to keep it short</b> but informative: trust us, we all have short attention spans.
4. <b>Use images</b> in each step: this will help the user to visualise your instructions. Make sure your images are clear and taken with a good camera (smartphones are ok too!)
