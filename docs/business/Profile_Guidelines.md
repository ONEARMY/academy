# Make a trustworthy Seller profile

To build and strengthen your business on the Bazar, it's important to have a trustworthy and unique profile.

**Here are some Guidelines on how to create an appealing profile.** 

> Info: Only listings with proper seller profiles will be **promoted on the Bazar homepage**, which will help to increase your visibility and sales.

## 1. Show your logo¬†‚Ä®
Make sure to make your profile recognisable by uploading a logo to your account. We recommend to use your company logo (if you don‚Äôt have any, you can create one with our [logo generator](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/universe/yourlogo)).

The recommended size for your logos is **250 x 250 pixels**, and the total size must be under **5 MB**. Image file types allowed are .jpeg and .png

## 2. Describe yourself¬†‚Ä®
A complete description of your business should state:¬†

* who you are
* what you stand for (mission/motivation)
* what your companies main activities are
* previous references, etc.¬†‚Ä®

Any relevant information that will provide detail to the customer on your business and make them **trust in your profile** and feel comfortable to purchase your items.

## 3. Give options to pay

In order to make sales on the Bazar, it is required to set up **at least one payment option** (duh!).


In order to increase your group of potential customers, try to set up both payment options - **Credit Card and Paypal** - to respond to most of the potential needs.


If you need more information on how to set up payment options, please refer to the Guide to [Set up your payment method](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/business/Setup_Payment).

##4. Get your reviews¬†‚Ä®
Reviews from customers reflect the purchase experience and can comment on: the quality of your communication, your item quality, delivery experience etc.‚Ä®‚Ä®They are publicly visible and can act as your portfolio, which serves as an **indicator for potential customers** to decide to buy or not buy from you.

We therefore strongly recommend you to ensure a **high quality of service** through your exchanges with the customer.

If customers do not leave a review on their own, you can **set your order status to ‚ÄúAwaiting review‚Äù** which will notify them with a reminder to write a review.¬†¬†
