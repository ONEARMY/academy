# Connect Your Stripe Account 

## Payments power the bazar 💸 


Stripe is the payment processor that powers the Bazar. You need a seperate account with Stripe, which allows you to manage all the information related to payments. Remember that it's required to have a connected Stripe account before posting listings. 

## Login to the Seller [Dashboard](https://bazar.preciousplastic.com/vendor.php?dispatch=auth.login_form&return_url=vendor.php)

## Go to your seller profile

## Scroll down and click "connect with Stripe" 
- Only registered organizations in certain countries can create an account. Check the [list](https://stripe.com/global) to see if your home country is supported 
- If your country is not supported, you can try setting up an account through [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas), or find another way and get creative 😜
- Paypal is not supported
