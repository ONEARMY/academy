## Connect your Stripe account for payment
- You need a seperate account with Stripe (payment processor), which allows you to manage all the information related to payments. 
- Only registered organizations in certain countries can create an account. Check the [list](https://stripe.com/global) to see if your home country is supported. 
- If your country is not supported, you can try setting up an account through [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas), or find another way and get creative 😜
- Paypal is not supported.

## Add a description
- A detailed description helps potential buyers know you and your organization. 
- Tell them your story of how you got started and what your focus is. This seems trivial but could be the difference between a sale or not.
