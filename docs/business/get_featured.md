# Get your listings featured ✨


We love showcasing great work, and promote sellers who put love into their work and appearance on the Bazar.

**If you would like to see your listings featured, make sure to follow the guidelines below.**

## Why featuring?

By featuring a selection of items, the Bazar aims to:

1. **Showcase great listings** in order to show users the diversity and quality of items available on the Bazar.

2. **Give visibility to great sellers** who respect the selection criterias (see below) as well as help increase their engagement on the Bazar.

3. **Increase sales** for the sellers that offer a great quality and service.

## Where do we promote?

- On the [Bazar Homepage](bazar.preciousplastic.com)
- In **Bazar newsletters** to Bazar users and followers
- On our **social media** ([Instagram](www.instagram.com/realpreciousplastic), [Facebook](www.facebook.com/preciousplasticcommunity))

## Selection criteria 🧐

These are the criteria we're looking for when selecting items to feature:

Criteria | Explanation | Priority level <span style="color:white"> </span>
--- | --- | ---
**Profile quality** | We would like to promote listings of sellers who put effort and care into their profiles and follow the **[Guidelines to set up a Seller Account](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/business/Account_Setup)** | Essential
**Listing quality** | A listing will be selected if it was set up well and meets the **[Listing Guidelines](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/business/Image_Size_Guidelines)**. | Essential
Rank in the **top 25** of relevant KPI | The listing must be in the top 25 of the relevant analysis. *For example, for the most sold items, we will base our selection on the sales of the previous period.* | Essential
**Not previously featured** | A listing that was already featured in the previous two months will not be selected. | Nice to have
**Listing diversity** | Different types of listings will be selected within a section. *For example: We won’t select 2 moulds of the same shape.* | Nice to have
**Seller diversity** | We aim to showcase listings from various sellers, to equally promote different projects in different countries. | If possible
