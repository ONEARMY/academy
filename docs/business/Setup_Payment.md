# Set up your payment method 💸

In order to sell on the Bazar, you will have to make sure that you have your payment set up properly. As payment processors on the Bazar we provide [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-gb-de) and [Paypal](https://paypal.com/). You will need to have at least one of those accounts to manage your payments, reimbursements, and invoices.

# The Bazar fee - 5% for the Community
We would like to offer the services of the Bazar without any charges, but the reality is: Running, maintaining and improving a platform like the Bazar requires a lot of financial and human resources.

This is why we have the Bazar fee, which means that 5% of each sale gets collected.
The fee is used to pay for the platform hosting, the bug-fixing, the technical support for sellers and customers, and in best case also the improvement and development of the platform.

So by selling your precious things on the Bazar, you also contribute to making this plastic recycling marketplace as accessible and smooth for plastic recyclers to buy and sell and help them succeed in their recycling project. :)

> **How are the Bazar fees collected?** Every month we will send out invoices, charging 5% of the amount you sold that month. Keep this in mind and calculate this into your item prices!


# Time to create listings 🎁

Profile and payment methods are set up? 

Then it's finally time to upload the items you would like to sell. To **get the most out of your listings**, increase your chances to get good sales and get promoted on the homepage, newsletters and social media, follow our [**Guidelines for creating good Bazar listings**](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/business/Image_Size_Guidelines).
