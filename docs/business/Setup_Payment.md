# Set up your payment method

## Our payment processor: Stripe

In order to sell on the Bazar, you will have to make sure that you have your payment set up properly. As the standard payment processor on the Bazar, we use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-gb-de). You will need to have a Stripe Account to manage your payments, reimbursements, and invoices.
Stripe is also where the Bazar fees will be collected (read more further down).

Don’t have an account already? [Set up your Stripe account.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)

- Creating an account is free
- You need to have a registered organisation in a Stripe supported country [country](https://stripe.com/global)
- If your country is not supported, you can try setting up an account through Stripe [Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas), or find another creative way around it

Once you are set, you can connect your Bazar account to your Stripe account.


## Step 1: Add a payment method

- Login to the [seller dashboard](https://newbazar.preciousplastic.com/my_admin_panel.php)

## The Bazar fee - 5% for the Community
We would like to offer the services of the Bazar without any charges, but the reality is: Running, maintaining and improving a platform like the Bazar requires a lot of human resources and money.

This is why we have the Bazar fee, which means that 5% of each sale gets collected.
It is then used to pay for the platform hosting, the bug-fixing, the technical support, the improvement and development of the platform etc.

So by selling your precious things on the Bazar, you also contribute to making this plastic recycling marketplace as accessible and smooth for plastic recyclers to buy and sell and help them succeed in their recycling project. pre

> **How are the Bazar fees collected?** Every month we will send out invoices (via stripe), charging 5% of the amount you sold that month. Keep this in mind and calculate this into your item prices!



## Happy selling 💸
Hope this is all clear, if you have any questions about this, best is to bring them up on the [#bazar-sellers channel](https://discord.gg/2E93VxB3CD) on Discord :)
